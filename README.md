# What is drugtest?
This application is intended to detect a possible risk of drug addiction in the students of "Escuela Superior de Cómputo" from "Instituto Politécnico Nacional" (MX).
The risk is determined by the evaluation of a questionnaire and a 3-chat analysis. The selected questionnaire is the "Tobacco, Alcohol, Prescription medication, and other Substance use" (TAPS) Tool.
The chats are txt files exported from WA by the student which are then sent to a classifier implemented on node with NLP. This module classifies chunks of each chat into Alcohol or
Tobacco use labels. It is also performed a sentiment analysis of each chat through Google Natural Language API.
In order to obtain statistics of the student's drugs use, an adminstrator section was asked to be developed.
